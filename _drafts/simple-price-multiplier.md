## Basic price multiplier
 `income @ total provided supply = Price * (additional supply + standard supply)`

 `B$1Ã—($A2+1)`

## Used to incentivize additional supply.

1. Price: top row, increases to right in 1% increments.
2. Supply: left column, moves from to top in 1% increments.
3. Squares represent income as a percentage of standard income.
3. The Yellow square represents the pricing system at its equilibrium point with no supply or demand pressures.
4. The Red squares represent the price at which supply is too expensive.
5. The Green squares represent the minimum price to motivate additional supply

## Price multiplier showing income for suppliers motivated by higher prices but sold after the price dropped.

1. The Yellow squares represent acceptable if not motivating income.

***

## Price multipliers also react to reduced supply.

2. Reducing supply initiates a price increase.
3. Stimulating an increase in supply.
3. Simultaneously reducing demand.
3. Blue squares represent equilibrium points created by supply constraints.

***

## If the supply constraint is permanent, the price multiplier never equalizes, shifting the equilibrium point.

2. Supply reduced to 2%.
2. Price increased 2%
3. Adjusted equilibrium provides a base income at 99.96% of normal.
3. 1 hour is 2% of a 50 hour work week.

***

## If the supply constraint is artificial, forces to recalibrate are twice as strong as the artificial forces.

1. The dark green squares represent sellers with additional supply motivated to sell at above market prices.
