1. TNCs are a marketplace.
2. Drivers are suppliers within that market.
2. The amount suppliers get paid varies based on demand.
3. But the amount of capital in the marketplace remains constant.
3. TNC revenue increases when system volume increases.
3. Uber is taking massive investments and paying lavish sign-on bonuses. The marketplace cannot grow unless an oversupply is created allowing for a sustainable price reduction.
3. And volume increases at a greater rate at lower prices.

## The TNC business model is the opposite of Drivers.
1. It is a payments processing company with a monopoly contract for a marketplace
2. Driver are suppliers in the market place
2. Driver revenue increases when demand is higher related to supply.
2. Pricing algorithms to maintain transaction volume in the markets
3. Lower Supply x Higher Price = Higher Supply x Lower Price
3. The algorithm is designed to maintain a consistent level of payments.
3. An increase in demand = A decrease in supply.
4. Uber requires bigger signon bonuses because the pricing algorithm is designed to satiate demand and maintain supply.
4. Therefore a decrease in supply should have a greater effect than an increase in demand on the pricing algorithm.

## surgenado applies that backward pressure on the system increasing relative income.

## Work 1% less. if you work 40, work 39.5. if you work 60, work 59.25.

1. It works if we do it in mass which is why we're going to pretend logout until we reach that point.
