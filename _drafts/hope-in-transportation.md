### Yes. There is one market force that so far has not emerged in consistent force.

***

## System wide supply inefficiencies.

***

### Supply inefficiencies have been seen from time to time usually occurring from natural disasters but have only been used in protest a few times such as the walk-off strike held over the weekend of October 18th 2015.

## What does this tell us?

2. The pricing algorithm adequately manages increases in demand.
1. The price multiplication algorithm has been publicly defended as not differentiating between reduced supply and increased demand.
3. Reductions in supply must be managed by the transportation network management.

## How is this useful?

***

### A transportation network operating in normal conditions.

## During normal conditions.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased supply.
3. Decreasing the price.

***

### A transportation network operating in supply restricted conditions.

## During supply restricted conditions.
1. The blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased supply.
3. Decreasing the price.

## If a restricted of supply can be maintained...
1. The Blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
1. The next wave of Blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased price.
2. Maintained by continuous waves of blue arrows.

## We just need a way to effectively [coordinate](coordinating-action.html).

### Cute, but as the strike on October 18th showed, systematic logoffs have proven hard for a distributed work force to coordinate.

## Hard, yes. Impossible, no.

## The algorithm that works for drivers.
