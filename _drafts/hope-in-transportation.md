### Yes. There is one market force that so far has not emerged in consistent force.

***

## System wide supply inefficiencies.

***

### Supply inefficiencies are seen from time to time such as during major storms, and the walk-off strike over the weekend of October 18th 2015.

## What does this tell us?

2. While the pricing algorithm adequately manages increases in demand.
3. Reductions in supply must be managed by the transportation network management.
1. The price multiplication algorithm has been publicly defended as not differentiating between reduced supply and increased demand.

## How is this useful?

***

### Here are normal TNC market forces.

### And this is how supply inefficiencies acts against those forces.

## During normal conditions.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased supply.
3. Decreasing the price.

## During supply restricted conditions.
1. The blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased supply.
3. Decreasing the price.

## If a restricted of supply can be maintained...
1. The Blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. The Yellow arrows of demand fuel increased pricing.
3. Fueling the Green arrows attracted supply.
1. The next wave of Blue arrows of reduced supply impart pressure on the yellow arrows of demand.
2. Creating a virtuous cycle of increased price.
2. Maintained by continuous waves of blue arrows.

## All nice and good, but as the strike on October 18th proved, systematic logoffs are impossible for a distributed work force to coordinate.

## Hard, yes. Impossible, no.

## We just need a way to effectively [coordinate](coordination.html).
