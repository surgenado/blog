1. If Drivers were to systematically logoff in a coordinated manner they would collectively generate a similar effect to a storm on the pricing algorithm increasing the price for respective demand levels.
4. Given the dependance on transportation networks, price increases are likely to be absorbed at a greater rate than demand is decreased, sustaining the price elevation.
5. Regulatory oversight will be justified if the transportation network management modifies its algorithm to target independent contractors operating within the accepted term of use but in opposition to the interests of the transportation network management.
