# So...
1. If Drivers were to systematically logoff in a coordinated manner, say a normally worked hour a week.
2. Drivers could create storm conditions from the pricing algorithm's perspective.
3. Increasing the pricing for corresponding demand levels.
4. At current levels of market saturation, the system should absorb price increases without a corresponding decrease in demand.
5. If the transportation network management modifies the algorithm to target drivers operating within the term of use but in opposition to the interests of the transportation network management, grounds for regulatory oversight are clearly justified.
6. They'll have to throw money at it.
7. Win-Win
