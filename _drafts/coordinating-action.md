# So based on the following criteria:
1. If Drivers were to systematically logoff in a coordinated manner they would collectively generate a similar effect to a storm on the pricing algorithm increasing the price for respective demand levels.
4. Given the dependance on transportation networks, price increases are likely to be absorbed at a greater rate than demand is decreased, sustaining a price elevation.
5. Transportation network algorithms are configured on the assumption that drivers cannot organize in an effective way.
5. Regulatory oversight will be justified if the transportation network management modifies its algorithm to target independent contractors operating within the accepted term of use but in opposition to the interests of the transportation network management.
3. The future is bleak without change.
