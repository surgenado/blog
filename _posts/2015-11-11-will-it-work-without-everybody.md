## But this is OUR situation.

{% youtube sUTt0LMhyas %}

## We need a tactic of equal and opposing force. We need to swim together.

## The challenge is that the equal and opposing force to an exploitive system built on blind greed is a cooperative system built on blind trust

2. Cooperation requires individual commitment to the greater good which isn't always an obvious benefit.
3. Greed always has its price.

## But also great rewards...
