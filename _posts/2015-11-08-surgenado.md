## At this stage of market dominance, the system will  absorb a little surge without a significant decrease in demand.

1. Passengers rely enough on TNCs to be price insensitive for low levels of surge.
2. Surge offsets the effect of a price reduction on driver income.
3. While the price multiplier is designed to respond to periods of high demand it doesn't differentiate between reduced supply increased demand.
4. According to Uber's interaction with government officials after storms generated high surge, this is an integral part of the system.
3. Buyer motivation guarantees a transaction, Seller motivation does not.

## If drivers were to generate surge in a rolling fashion, with coordinated system log outs, The drivers would essentially create storm conditions from the pricing algorithm's perspective.
