1. The trend is a flattening of the supply/demand curves with relationship to price.
2. While a benefit for the consumers, the passengers, sustainable transactions require that both parties benefit.
1. Lyft goes out of business as it is unable to retain drivers while competing as a discount competitor.
2. Uber invests a portion of the billions it made from the labor and investment of drivers and their vehicles to purchase autonomous vehicles

1. Autonomous vehicles will be designed to operate at a cost that decimates human driver's ability to compete while earning a living wage.
1. At their base price, autonomous vehicles will compete with municipal transportation disrupting municipal transportation's ability to maintain fares at times of high demand.
