## This graph is often used to explain the incentivizing effect of elevated price on "suppliers".

## But what is the effect of price decreases on "supply"?

1. The above graph is a simple commodities market graph.
1. It Describes the motives of businesses.
2. If the on-demand economy had been virally grown that might be an applicable graph.
2. But in the on-demand economy sign-on bonuses are huge incentive to create conditions of oversupply.
3. Oversupply with the goal of reducing pricing.

## What is the human cost?
3. What effect does a decrease in market price have on that human?
4. Is it the same as traditional commodities market?

###  Humans can handle irritations two ways:
1. Accommodate it.
2. Resolve it.

## This graph represents the factors influencing a human dealing with an irritation.

## Axis
1. I - Level of irritation
2. S - Effectiveness of solution

## Curve Elasticity
1. M1 - Motivation - Desire to solve irritation.
1. M2 - Motivation - Desire to partially solve irritation.
2. F1 - Frustration - Acceptable irritation level.
2. F2 - Frustration - Elevated irritation level.

## Elasticity Forces
1. Irrationally Optimistic - Yellow (F1-F2) - Not frustrated even though irritation is above acceptable level.
2. Apathetic - Brown (M1-M2) - Irritations are low, solvability is low, incentivizing minimal effort.
3. Accommodating - Orange (M1-F2-M2-F1) Solvability is medium, irritation is medium. Some irritations are solved, some are tolerated.
4. Highly Motivated - Chartreuse (M1-M2-F2) - Solvability is high, irritation is high, incentivizing desire to resolve irritation.
5. Unmotivated - Dark Brown (A2-F2-F1) - Solvability is high, irrational optimism negates frustration, incentivizing minimal effort.

## Logical Conclusion:
1. A human faced with the irritation of getting paid less and presented with the solution of working more, will work more.

## But humans aren't that simple, there are additional forces surrounding those.

## Surrounding Forces
1. Anger - Red (M1-F2) - Beyond Frustration, Irritations are unsolvable.
2. Resignation - Purple (M1-F1) - Irritation level is greater than desired solvability but below acceptable frustration.
3. Contentment - Dark Brown (M2-F1) - Irritations are all solvable without frustration.
4. Motivation - (F2-M2) - Solvability is high, irritation exceeds acceptable frustration, incentivizing desire to resolve irritation.

## And its time to tap into those...
