#### A discussion on the mechanics of variable pricing in networked markets is available [here](market-dynamics.html)

## To model the dynamics of the transportation network market, we'll start with a model of a single transportation network.
![Transportation Network Supply and Demand](/blog/img/tnc.png){: .center-image }

#### Simplified Transportation Network
1. P1: The base fare: Adequate supply for typical demand.
2. P2: First price multiplier: Triggered by either an increase in demand or a reduction in supply.
3. P3. Second price multiplier: Triggered by simultaneous increase in demand and a reduction in supply.
4. P4. Third price multiplier: Displayed by the transportation network management to disincentives demand and incentivize supply.

###  Additional supply curve added because the availability of transportation is subject to variables other than price. There events of mass attendance `concerts` and there are constrictions of availability. `natural disasters`

## Now lets show a single transportation network with the market forces applied.

![Transportation Network Market Forces](/blog/img/tnc-forces.png){: .center-image }

#### Actions Generating Transportation Network Market Forces
1. Red Arrows: Passengers refusing to pay higher prices
2. Yellow Arrows: Passengers willing to pay higher prices
3. Green Arrows: Higher prices incentivizing drivers to work.

#### Effect of Transportation Network Market Forces on Price
1. Red Arrows: Price reduction.
2. Yellow Arrows: Price increase.
3. Green Arrows: Price reduction.

##  And now the full Transportation Network Market.

![Transportation Network Market](/blog/img/tnc_market.png){: .center-image }

1. The Transportation Network Market has settled into a duopoly.
2. The dominant operator is represented by a black pin.
3. The secondary operator by a pink pin.
4. The other pins represent multiplied prices

## And the Transportation Network Market with Market Forces.

![Transportation Network Market](/blog/img/tnc_market-forces.png){: .center-image }

1. Other than a reduction in market share, the dominant transportation network operator is unaffected by the presence of an additional operator.
2. The secondary operator deals with the following challenges.

***

3. Reduced Base Fare: set at P0 to maintain demand in the shadow of the dominant operator at P1
2. Discounted base fare reduces driver supply as working drivers join the dominant operator for better pay, represented by the Green Arrow pointing away from the secondary operator's equilibrium point.
3. With a competitive advantage based on price, the secondary competitor is highly sensitive to the dominant operators business decisions.
