### Why should you understand this?

2. Individual transactions are conducted blind, relying on the trust that the the transaction price was honestly set at rates governed by free market dynamics.
1. This is a discussion of those marketplaces and all potential dynamics.
1. These are the models used by companies in the on-demand economy to price their services and determine wages required to maintain a sufficient workforce supply.

#### Caveats
3. Supply is relative to demand and vice versa
2. Price is relative to quantity and vice versa
1. This is a theoretical discussion

## Here's the graph most commonly used to tout the benefits of inexhaustible supply provided by a variable pricing mechanism.

### Simplified marketplace dynamics
1. Demand is desire to buy at a given price.
2. Supply is willingness to sell at a given price.
3. When desire to buy and willingness to sell are at an equal price, a transaction occurs.
4. When supply has been exhausted by demand, increasing the price incentivizes additional supply.
5. Conversely demand generated at a lower price is dis-incentivized at a higher price.

### This model is massively simplified, it describes an fully open and transparent commodity marketplace where the only friction to transaction is price.

## How does supply and demand work in a more complicated marketplace? Like how does the modern transportation ecosystem work?

### It's complicated so we're going to start with a model of a single transportation network.
![Transportation Network Supply and Demand](/blog/img/tnc.png){: .center-image }

#### Simplified Transportation Network
1. P1: The base fare: Adequate supply for typical demand.
2. P2: First price multiplier: Triggered by either an increase in demand or a reduction in supply.
3. P3. Second price multiplier: Triggered by simultaneous increase in demand and a reduction in supply.
4. P4. Third price multiplier: Displayed by the transportation network management to disincentives demand and incentivize supply.

###  Additional supply curve added because the availability of transportation is subject to variables other than price. There events of mass attendance `concerts` and there are constrictions of availability. `natural disasters`

## Now lets show a simplified transportation network with the market forces applied.

![Transportation Network Market Forces](/blog/img/tnc-forces.png){: .center-image }

#### Actions Generating Transportation Network Market Forces
1. Red Arrows: Passengers refusing to pay higher prices
2. Yellow Arrows: Passengers willing to pay higher prices
3. Green Arrows: Higher prices incentivizing drivers to work.

#### Effect of Transportation Network Market Forces on Price
1. Red Arrows: Price reduction.
2. Yellow Arrows: Price increase.
3. Green Arrows: Price reduction.
