## Now that we've covered the mechanics of basic supply and demand, and the mechanics of variable priced transportation networks, let's look at the evolution of the modern transportation network.

***

### Before everybody had a smartphone, there were three transportation options.

1. Walking
2. Public Transportation
3. A Taxi

#### This graph is oversized to show:
1. Regulations setting both the price and the supply of Taxis leaving unmet demand in the market.
2. If Municipal Transit was market rate it'd be provided at a fraction of the supply currently enjoyed.  

***

### Smartphones enabled transportation networks provide additional service.

### While there are multiple transportation networks, For clarity's sake we're going to model the two largest operators.
1. Both were introduced as a premium alternative to Taxis, providing convenience and rapid pickup for a premium price.
4. Their placements on the graph represent the market niche they started in.
5. Uber providing a premium priced solution to the taxi shortage with guaranteed availability using a price multiplier to manage supply and demand.
6. Lyft focusing on an enhanced experience with "cool" fistbumping drivers and pink furry carstaches.

***

### The colored arrows represent market forces generated by the price multiplier.
1. Green Arrows drivers logging on to the system for higher earnings increasing supply.
2. Red Arrows represent passengers refusing higher fares, reducing demand.
3. Yellow arrows represent passengers accepting higher fares, maintaining demand.

***

## Then Uber lowered its base fare below the regulated Taxi Fare

## Increasing demand while maintaining supply with its price multiplier.

### Disrupting instead of supplementing the transportation market for the first time.
1. Lyft, focusing on is product over its market position, did not initially match Uber's price reduction.
2. Which cost it market share.
3. So when Lyft did match Uber's price reduction, it did so at a reduced demand for its service.
4. Taxis were now faced with a competitor that had greater convenience and lower price.

***

## And then as the dominant provider in the transportation market Uber introduced its "Tick-Tock" market expansion strategy.

1. "The Tick" - Utilize large recruitment bonuses to increase the supply of drivers towards the end of the year to maintain supply and reduce the price multiplier during the high volume holiday season.
2. "The Tock" - Lower rates at the beginning of the year to maintain demand for the increased supply of drivers.

***

## It should be noted that while this is a discussion of transportation,  Uber's business is as payment processing company
4. Uber charges a commission for matching rides and processing the payment.
5. Though the driver retains the majority of each individual transaction, Uber makes business decisions base on volume effects.
6. The fare only needs to be high enough to not reduce supply below minimum demand.

***

## Uber's expansion creates ripples through the transportation market.

1. Lyft reduces its base fare below Uber's, becoming the discount transportation network.
2. Taxis increasingly struggle to retain drivers as demand is reduced.

***

### It should also be noted here that the Taxi's business model is also not about providing transportation.
1. The business model for Taxi industry is medallion owners and taxi companies lease medallions and vehicles to drivers.
2. Drivers then collect money for that lease from passengers, keeping what they make over the lease amount as pay.

***

## Even with out expanding Uber continues to grow.

1. The big Green arrow shows the cumulative force of higher earnings attracting drivers into the system.
2. And the big Yellow shows the cumulative force of demand for the service increasing demand levels.
3. As the supply approaches the capacity of public transportation, and the relative demand drops below the level accepted by regulators, the supply and demand curves shift in respect to Municipal Transportation and Regulated Taxis.
4. Increasing the potential to disrupt Municipal Transportation revenue generation.

***

## Lyft implements a price multiplier to guarantee it supply

1. Not the Green Arrow for driver incentive pointing from Lyft's base fare to Uber's base fare.  
2. While the Green Arrows always work in Uber's favor, as the domininant transportation network, Lyft's base fare, at a discount to Uber's, incentivizes drivers to log off of Lyft and log into Uber.

***

## Uber does the "Tick-Tock" expansion again, causing disruption.
![Urban Transportation Market](/blog/img/transportation_market-tnc8.png){: .center-image }

1. Lyft further reduces fares to be at a discount to Uber.
2. Pressure increases on Taxis

4. Realigning graph to represent market position.

## Fall 2015 - Uber starts its "Tick" cycle with driver recruitment.

## Spring 2016 - Uber completes it "Tock" cycle, lowering fares

2. Drivers earnings are squeezed again, increasing hours driven, further reducing opportunities for price multipliers to increased earnings.
3. Drivers still trapped in long term leases from when earnings were reliable.
1. Lyft's fares are reduced, shared rides compete directly with Municipal Transit.
