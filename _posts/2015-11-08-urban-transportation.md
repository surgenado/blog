## Let's look at the evolution of the modern urban transportation market, its associated market forces, as well as trends and their effects.

***

### Prior to 2010, there were three primary urban transportation options.

![Urban Transportation Market](/blog/img/transportation_market-tnc0.png){: .center-image }

1. Walking
2. Public Transportation
3. A Taxi

#### This graph is oversized to demonstrate:
1. That regulations setting both the price and the supply of Taxis left significant unmet demand in the market.
2. Municipal Transit maintains provides its service with the support of subsidies, without them it would have to either reduce service or increase price impacting the functioning of the city.  

***

### Starting in 2010, Smartphones enabled transportation networks provide additional service, this graph shows the market in 2013

### While there are multiple transportation networks, For clarity's sake we're going to model the two largest operators.
1. Both were introduced as a premium alternative to Taxis, providing convenience and rapid pickup for a premium price.
4. Their placements on the graph represent the market niche they started in.
5. Uber providing a premium priced solution to the taxi shortage with guaranteed availability using a price multiplier to manage supply and demand.
6. Lyft focusing on an enhanced experience with "cool" fistbumping drivers and furry pink carstaches.

***

### The colored arrows show the market forces generated by the price multiplier.
1. Green Arrows drivers logging on to the system for higher earnings increasing supply.
2. Red Arrows represent passengers refusing higher fares, reducing demand.
3. Yellow arrows represent passengers accepting higher fares, maintaining demand.

## In 2013 Uber lowered its base fare below the regulated Taxi Fare

## Increasing demand while maintaining supply with its price multiplier.

## Truly disrupting instead of supplementing the transportation market for the first time.
1. Lyft, focusing on product over market position, did not initially match Uber's price reduction.
2. Which cost it market share.
3. So when Lyft did match Uber's price reduction, it did so at a reduced demand for its service.
4. Taxis were now faced with a competitor that had greater convenience at a lower price.

***

## And then Uber increased its level of disruption with a "Tick-Tock" market expansion strategy over the winter of 2013-14

1. "The Tick" - Utilize large recruitment bonuses to increase the supply of drivers towards the end of the year to maintain supply and reduce the price multiplier during the high volume holiday season, retaining customers.
2. "The Tock" - Lower rates at the beginning of the year to maintain demand with an increased supply of drivers.

***

### It should be noted that while this is a discussion of transportation, the transportation network company (TNC) business model is payment processing.
4. TNCs matching rides in order to process the payment of which they take a commission.
5. Though the driver retains the majority of each individual transaction, Pricing decisions are made by the TNC with a focus on their bottom line as a payments processor.
6. From the TNC perspective, the fare needs only to be high enough to keep a significant number of drivers from aversely reacting.

# Uber's expansion creates ripples through the transportation market.

![Urban Transportation Market](/blog/img/transportation_market-tnc5.png){: .center-image }

1. Lyft reduces its base fare below Uber's, becoming the discount transportation network.
2. Taxis increasingly struggle to retain drivers as passenger demand is reduced.
3. I do not know if Taxi companies reduced the fees charged drivers at this point or not.

***

### It should also be noted here that the Taxi's business model is also not about providing transportation.
1. The business model for Taxi industry is medallion owners and taxi companies lease medallions and vehicles to drivers.
2. Drivers then collect money for that lease from passengers, keeping what they make over the lease amount as pay.

***

## Uber continues to grow organically

1. The big Green arrow shows the cumulative force of higher earnings attracting drivers into the system.
2. And the big Yellow shows the cumulative force of demand for the service increasing demand levels.
3. As the supply approaches the capacity of public transportation, and the relative demand drops below the level accepted by regulators, the supply and demand curves shift in respect to Municipal Transportation and Regulated Taxis.
4. Increasing the potential to disrupt Municipal Transportation revenue generation.

## Lyft implements a price multiplier to guarantee it supply
![Urban Transportation Market](/blog/img/transportation_market-tnc7.png){: .center-image }

1. Not the Green Arrow for driver incentive pointing from Lyft's base fare to Uber's base fare.  
2. While the Green Arrows always work in Uber's favor, as the domininant transportation network, Lyft's base fare, at a discount to Uber's, incentivizes drivers to log off of Lyft and log into Uber.

***

## Winter 2014-15, Uber performs the "Tick-Tock" expansion again, causing disruption.
![Urban Transportation Market](/blog/img/transportation_market-tnc8.png){: .center-image }

1. Lyft further reduces fares to be at a discount to Uber.
2. Pressure increases on Taxis

## 2015

## Fall 2015 - Uber starts its "Tick" cycle with driver recruitment.

***

## Spring 2016 - Uber will complete it's "Tock" cycle by lowering fares again.

2. Drivers earnings are squeezed again, increasing hours driven, further reducing opportunities for price multipliers to increased earnings.
3. Drivers still trapped in long term leases from when earnings were reliable.
1. Lyft's fares are reduced, shared rides compete directly with Municipal Transit.

## What's next?

## We can do nothing and prepare for [The Bleak Future of the Urban Transportation Market](future-of-urban-transportation.html) to look forward to.
