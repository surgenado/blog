## Why is this important?
1. Most variable priced networked markets are privately owned and as a result the mechanics are opaque.
2. Transactions are conducted on the trust that the transaction occurred at a fair market price.
3. These networks are a growing sector of the economy.
1. These types of models are used by companies in the on-demand economy to price their services and determine wages required to maintain a sufficient workforce supply.

## This discussion covers the forces governing these marketplaces and the dynamics of their interaction.
3. How those dynamics affect pricing.
4. How those dynamics affect the earnings of suppliers in those marketplaces

## Caveats
3. These graphs are crude approximations of market dynamics, the curves may be steeper or flatter depending on the market.
2. Supply is relative to demand and vice versa
2. Price is relative to quantity and vice versa

## This simple model is commonly used to explain the benefits of variable pricing mechanisms.

### Primary benefit: demand sensitive pricing enables an inexhaustible supply

## Simplified marketplace dynamics
1. Demand is desire to buy at a given price.
2. Supply is willingness to sell at a given price.
3. When desire to buy and willingness to sell are at an equal price, a transaction occurs.
4. When currently priced supply has been exhausted by demand, increasing the price incentivizes additional supply.
5. Conversely, a percentage of demand generated at lower prices will be dis-incentivized at a higher price, reducing demand.

## This is a simplified model, it describes an open and transparent commodity marketplace where the only friction to transaction is price.

## Real world marketplaces are more complex and need and expanded model to describe the additional forces involved.

### Here is a model of a single transportation network.

## Single Transportation Network Model
1. P1: The base fare: Adequate supply for typical demand.
2. P2: First price multiplier: Triggered by either an increase in demand or a reduction in supply.
3. P3. Second price multiplier: Triggered by simultaneous increase in demand and a reduction in supply.
4. P4. Third price multiplier: Displayed by the transportation network management to disincentives demand and incentivize supply.

###  Additional supply curve demonstrates the impact on the system when supply is affected independently of demand. Demand can be increased by events of mass attendance `concerts` while supply can be constricted by reductions in mobility. `natural disasters`

## These are the market forces present in a single transportation network.

### Actions Generating Transportation Network Market Forces
1. Red Arrows: Passengers refusing to pay higher prices
2. Yellow Arrows: Passengers willing to pay higher prices
3. Green Arrows: Higher prices incentivizing drivers to work.

### Effect of Transportation Network Market Forces on Price
1. Red Arrows: Price reduction.
2. Yellow Arrows: Price increase.
3. Green Arrows: Price reduction.
