1. Lyft goes out of business as it is unable to retain drivers while competing as a discount competitor.
2. Uber invests a portion of the billions it made from the labor and investment of drivers and their vehicles to purchase autonomous vehicles

1. Autonomous vehicles compete with municipal transportation at times of low demand disrupting municipal transportation ability to provide a flat fare at time of hight demand.
