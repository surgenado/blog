## Given the arguments laid out in previous posts, the following criteria are pertinent to drivers:
1. If Drivers systematically coordinate logoffs, collectively they would generate a similar pressure as a storm on the pricing algorithm effecting an increase the price relative to the demand level.
4. Given the dependance on transportation networks, price increases should be absorbed at a greater rate than demand is decreased, sustaining a price elevation.
5. Transportation network algorithms are configured on the assumption that drivers cannot organize in an effective way.
5. Regulatory oversight will be justified if the transportation network management modifies its algorithm to target independent contractors operating within the accepted term of use but in opposition to the interests of the transportation network management.
3. Without a balance in the power dynamic between transportation network management and its operators, the future is bleak for the operators.
